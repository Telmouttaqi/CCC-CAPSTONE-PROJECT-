        <p>
          Our application, the Cultural Connections Calendar, is designed to
          allow people to create gatherings, great and small, which
          celebrate their rich cultural diversity in a positive and educational
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining a bulletin board style interface with a social calendar,
          this app seeks to provide a means to those who want to share their pride
          in their rich cultural traditions with others through festival or market
          type environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users and Guests of the app should understand that the purpose is to celebrate
          and perpetuate the qualities that make humans good - respect, tolerance and a
          willingness to learn from and share with each other.  The idea is less Renaissance
          festival and more authentic, living heritage festival in the spirit of global community.

          In the ongoing wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, people are eager to get out and experience
          things old and new.  Many people had the opportunity to learn about things in our world
          while in isolation and are eager to experience them live.  With current global
          and national conditions such as they are, what better time to come together in the spirit
          of togetherness with those who seek to support a more hopeful future?
